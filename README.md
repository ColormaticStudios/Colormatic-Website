# Colormatic Website
[colormatic.org](https://colormatic.org)

This project uses SvelteKit along with TypeScript and Sass. It's configured for static site generation (SSG) and prerendering at compile time to create a simple static website for Nginx to serve, with very little client-side rendering (CSR).

The Colormatic website is developed with accordance to modern web standards, however a legacy website will be available in the future for older/less capable browsers.

To download the project, run:
```
git clone git@git.colormatic.org:ColormaticStudios/Colormatic-Website.git
cd Colormatic-Website
npm install
```
You can run the project locally with:
